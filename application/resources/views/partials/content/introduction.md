Welcome to my professional profile. I am now available for work across the North-west of England. Currently based in South Lancashire, in the Liverpool / Manchester corridor. 

Seeking junior Laravel positions. 

Range of skills encompassing both front-end & back-end.

Strong communicator.

Enjoy working in a team-environment.

Domain knowledge across several sectors including automotive, clinical research and civil engineering.


across multidisciplinary teams including such groups as Principal (Clincal) Investigators and Chief Engineering Project Managers.

Building on a strong foundation in DBMS & desktop application development, I moved into Web Development in the mid 2000s. In 2016 I decided to augment my front-end skills, undertaking a Cert IV in Web Technologies, at Central TAFE, Western Australia (equivalent to UK HNC) . On returning to the UK I have continued to develop a comprehensive skillset to include the Laravel PHP framework.
