## It has been some time since you last worked, what's the story?

## Why did you switch from using the .NET framework to a PHP framework?

I worked with Microsoft technolgies for a long time, having worked as an Analyst Programmer at Birmingham University for nearly 15 years. I wanted to take on a fresh challenge. For me that went going back to college and learning a completely new set of development technologies! It is interesting to know both sides, but ultimately you have to 'pick a horse', and remain with it in order to amass sufficient  information that is current.

## You have worked with a Microsoft stack in the past, would you consider positions using this technology?
In theory yes, but in practice, this is not likely. Why? My recent focus has been on Laravel PHP development. The .NET framework was at version 2.0 when I last worked with it. Increasing complexity is driving the industry to more specialisation, and frankly, it is not possible to be good at everything! I believe that switching between different technology stacks is sub-optimal for both employer and employee. In contrast to the web development work, in terms of databases, I can be more flexible about working with alternative DB platforms, including MS-SQL-Server.


## Would you consider short-term / contracting work?
At present I am looking for a permanent position.

## Would you consider a more senior role than 'entry-level'?
Initially I would like to gain confidence at an entry-level, and willing to accept a rate commensurate with this. However, due to the fact that I have previous experience in the industry, and beacuse I am more mature candidate, I would hope to advance quickly. In this context I would be happy to take-on further responsibilities down-the-line.


## Would you work with other PHP frameworks, or native PHP?
Possibly. My preference is of course for Laravel, though I do feel I could pick-up another framework relatively quickly. The assumption on both sides would have to be that a transition period would be required, and sufficient time alloted to allow this to happen.  

## Would you consider positions further afield / working away?
At present I am looking for positions in the NW of England, more specifically in the Liverpool-Preston-Manchester corridors. I live right by the M6, near Wigan, which is an excellent base from which to commute! I would not be aversed to working for short periods outside of the region, however a permanent relocation would need to be worthwhile financially. 

## What is your honest assessment of your skill level?
In terms of the traditional Junior, Mid & Senior Developer hierarchy, I would say that I am midway between Junior and Mid-Level. I already have the experience of working in the IT industry for many years. I have managed my own projects across the whole of the Software Development Lifecycle, dealt with clients and contributed to the formation of Standard Operating Procedures. However, I am relatively new to my current development stack, and need to gain more experience before advancing further. Armed with an intsenive period of self-directed study, I believe I am now ready to re-enter the labout market, equipped with a comprehensive set of skills & experience.       

## Do you consider yourself to be 'Full Stack'?

Yes ... and no. I have knowledge of server administration, databases , front-end development, and back-end development. However, the sheer breadth of information out there means that it's getting harder to claim a comprehensive knowledge of all aspects. I have chosen to leverage my previous experience of back-end development, and focus my attention there, particularly on the Laravel framework. That said, I do enjoy front-end work, as it's an opportunity to get creative! I also retain a working-knowledge of SQL databases.
